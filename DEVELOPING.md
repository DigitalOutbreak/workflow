## What this project is

**`@digitaloutbreak/workflow`** is an opinionated, cross-agent scaffold for AI coding workflows.
It installs into any project to give Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI (and ~12 more) a
shared `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` brief, six required context docs in
`docs/context/`, two skills (`/workflow-init`, `/site-init`), a PR-first `/feature` lifecycle,
`/roadmap`, `/cleanup`, and a `code-scanner` agent. Product bootstrap also configures a
framework-aware CI/CD baseline when the user opts in.

**Install paths** (which the package supports today):

1. `npx skills add DigitalOutbreak/workflow -g` — preferred. Uses the open `skills.sh`
   ecosystem, installs to `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/` (covers ~15 agents).
2. `npx @digitaloutbreak/workflow` — legacy CLI in `bin/cli.js`. Claude / Codex / Gemini only.
3. `bash bin/init.sh ./target` — bare-bones script fallback when no npx.

```

## What ships vs what doesn't (the lock)

`package.json` `files` field controls what `npm publish` bundles:

```json
"files": ["bin/", "skills/", "CLAUDE.md", "AGENTS.md", "GEMINI.md", "LICENSE", "docs/", ".claude/", "templates/"]
```

Plus `.npmignore` excludes specific files from those directories:

```
**/settings.local.json    # local Claude permissions — never ship
README.html               # bulky duplicate of README.md
.impeccable*              # design-skill outputs
site/blog-preview*.html   # local preview renders
DEVELOPING.md             # this file
```

Run `npm test`, `npm run test:smoke`, and `npm run test:pack` before any publish.
The artifact test specifically protects the product and site preset payloads from source/package drift.

## Common dev tasks

**Test the CLI locally without publishing:**
```sh
node bin/cli.js --help
node bin/cli.js init-site /tmp/test-site-init
```

**Test a skill end-to-end:**
```sh
cd /tmp && mkdir test-workflow && cd test-workflow
npx skills add DigitalOutbreak/workflow -g
# then in Claude Code: /workflow-init
```

**Ship a release:**
```sh
# 1. Work on a feature/fix/chore branch and bump package.json
# 2. Run npm test, npm run test:smoke, npm audit --omit=dev, npm run test:pack
# 3. Open a pull request and wait for the required Quality check
# 4. Merge through GitHub
# 5. Pull main with --ff-only, then npm publish
# 6. Verify: npm view @digitaloutbreak/workflow version
```

**Run the marketing site locally:**
```sh
cd site && npm run dev
```

## Things to watch for (gotchas)

1. **Anything in `docs/` ships.** If you edit `docs/context/current-feature.md` with real project info while testing `/feature`, that info ships to npm users. The /feature skill writes to that path. Either: (a) don't use /feature on this project, (b) reset the file before publish, or (c) add specific paths to `.npmignore`.

2. **`.claude/settings.local.json` regenerates.** Claude Code recreates this file when you grant new bash permissions during a session. It's in `.gitignore` and `.npmignore` — leave it alone, but be aware it exists locally even though it's invisible to git/npm.

3. **The legacy TOML install path.** `bin/cli.js` no longer writes `~/.gemini/commands/*.toml` (commit d7606fb fixed this on May 27). But users who installed before that still have stale TOML files that *conflict* with the new skill install in Gemini CLI v0.43+. The README still says they're "harmless but inert" — that's wrong, should be updated to "delete to resolve conflicts."

4. **Cross-agent agent (subagent) parity is incomplete.** `/feature` and `/cleanup` skills work in ~15 agents. The `code-scanner` agent is Claude Code only — Codex has its own TOML-based subagent format but the scaffold doesn't dual-install it yet.

5. **The marketing site is separate from the site starter template.** `site/` is not published. `templates/site/` must be published because `init-site` reads it at runtime. Do not bundle changes under `site/` with scaffold releases.

6. **Published artifacts must match GitHub.** Never publish from uncommitted or unpushed source. A release is complete only when the tagged/merged source, npm version, and tested tarball describe the same files.

## Current state of open work

**Shipped (live as of 0.17.0):**
- ✓ Junk cleanup — removed `settings.local.json`, `README.html`, `test.md` from tarball
- ✓ `.npmignore` defense layer
- ✓ Gemini TOML fix (commit d7606fb)
- ✓ Site-init improvements (CWD decision, free-text prose, sibling filter)
- ✓ /blog with three posts (rebuttal, constructor, /feature explainer)
- ✓ `/roadmap` skill and Open Skills copies for product projects

**In 0.18.0:**
- PR-first `/feature complete` flow with full-diff review and post-merge verification
- Framework-aware CI/CD and branch-protection setup in `/workflow-init`
- Delivery workflow template, Dependabot, pull-request template, and optional GitHub Project setup
- Package-level CI and product/site artifact tests
- `templates/site/` included in the npm payload

**Open / parked (research mode):**
- README's "harmless but inert" claim about TOML files — wrong, should warn
- CLI auto-cleanup of legacy `~/.gemini/commands/*.toml` on install — closes the loop for pre-d7606fb users
- Optional: path-scoped rules support (`.claude/rules/` with YAML `paths:`) for monorepo users
- Optional: `@AGENTS.md` import pattern in CLAUDE.md to reduce duplication across root briefs
- Optional: dual-install `code-scanner` as a Codex TOML agent for cross-agent parity

## Architectural decisions worth remembering

- **`@-imports` over `.claude/rules/`** for the scaffold's root brief — chosen for cross-agent compat. Rules are Claude-only.
- **Tiered context** (auto / on-demand / executed) — the load strategy, named in the blog. Don't conflate with token caps.
- **Skills + context docs are a pair** — the skill is what makes the markdown *living state* (writes to current-feature.md, backlog.md). Without skills, docs are static notes.
- **Reincarnation** — sessions are ephemeral, on-disk state persists. `/clear` is a feature, not a problem. Named in the blog.

## Voice / writing notes

- Linear-style design language. Dark canvas, single lavender accent, no gradients, no border-left stripes (impeccable absolute-bans).
- Blog tone: direct declaratives, short sentences, no throat-clearing. Cut "this is what" / "there's a subtler point" / "the natural pushback."
- Keep buzzwords *only* when they earn their place: reincarnation, living doc, lifecycle, state surface, constructor.
- Anti-references: SaaS marketing register, AI-slop landing pages, prompt-injection blog content (e.g., the OpenClaw genre).
