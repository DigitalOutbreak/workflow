# Coding Standards

> **Starter note:** the conventions below describe the stack the OS project ships on — Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 — with sections for Drizzle ORM if you've picked it. The `/workflow-init` flow will rewrite these sections based on your actual stack picks; if you ran the CLI bare (no interview), edit the sections that don't match. The "no `any` types", "functional components only", "naming", and "code quality" sections are stack-agnostic and stay regardless.

## Project Commands

> Replace with your project's actual commands.
> Keep this list and `docs/context/delivery-workflow.md` in sync; CI must run commands that really exist.

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run start` — run the production build
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run format` — Prettier on `**/*.{ts,tsx}`

## TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types - use proper typing or `unknown`
- Define interfaces for all props, API responses, and data models
- Use type inference where obvious, explicit types where helpful

## React

- Functional components only (no class components)
- Use hooks for state and side effects
- Keep components focused - one job per component
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## Next.js

- Server components by default
- Only use `'use client'` when needed (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Use Server Actions for form submissions and simple mutations
- Use API routes when you need:
  - Webhooks (Stripe, GitHub, etc.)
  - File uploads with progress tracking
  - Long-running operations
  - Specific HTTP status codes or headers
  - Endpoints for future mobile/CLI clients
  - Third-party integrations
- Otherwise, fetch data directly in server components
- Dynamic routes for item/collection pages

## Tailwind CSS v4

**CRITICAL**: We are using Tailwind CSS v4, which uses CSS-based configuration.

- **DO NOT** create `tailwind.config.ts` or `tailwind.config.js` files (those are for v3)
- All theme configuration must be done in CSS using the `@theme` directive in `src/app/globals.css`
- Use CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, etc.
- No JavaScript-based config allowed

Example v4 configuration:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-primary: oklch(50% 0.2 250);
}
```

## File Organization

- Components: `src/components/[feature]/ComponentName.tsx`
- Pages: `src/app/[route]/page.tsx`
- Server Actions: `src/actions/[feature].ts`
- Types: `src/types/[feature].ts`
- Lib/Utils: `src/lib/[utility].ts`

Common default shape:

```text
{{project-root}}/
  app/                Next.js App Router (routes, layouts, server actions)
  components/         shadcn/ui + project components
  hooks/              React hooks
  lib/                shared utilities, db, auth clients
  public/             static assets
  docs/
    context/          standing AI/project context
    specs/            authoritative specs
```

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase (`ItemCard.tsx`)
- Files: Match component name or kebab-case
- Functions: camelCase
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (no prefix)

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Use shadcn/ui components where applicable
- No inline styles
- Dark mode first, light mode as option

## Database

- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations
- Always use `drizzle-kit generate` followed by `drizzle-kit migrate` for schema changes (not `drizzle-kit push`)
- Run `drizzle-kit check` before committing to verify migrations are in sync
- Production deployments must run `drizzle-kit migrate` before the app starts

## Data Fetching

- Server components fetch directly with Drizzle
- Client components use Server Actions
- Validate all inputs with Zod

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch in Server Actions
- Return `{ success, data, error }` pattern from actions
- Display user-friendly error messages via toast

## Code Quality

- No commented-out code unless specified
- No unused imports or variables
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
