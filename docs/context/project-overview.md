## ▸ At a glance

**[Product in one sentence — the value proposition the user feels.]**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Built for** | [primary customer / persona] |
| **Phase 1 (v1)** | [what ships first — minimum useful version] |
| **Path to scale** | [how this stays cheap to extend — multi-tenant from day one? plugin model? etc.] |
| **Productize trigger** | [the condition that flips this from internal/pilot to publicly sold] |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  User([Primary user]) -->|primary flow| App[App]
  ExternalA[External system A] -->|webhook| App
  ExternalB[External system B] -->|webhook| App
  App <--> DB[(Database)]
```

> [One pithy invariant about the data flow above — e.g., "If the app goes down, leads still land in the primary system and aren't lost."]

## 🎯 The problem we're solving

**[Name the problem in two words.]** [One sentence on why it matters.]

| System | What it owns |
|---|---|
| [Tool A] | [data class A] |
| [Tool B] | [data class B] |
| ... | ... |

> **[The sentence the customer would say out loud to describe the pain.]**

### What v1 removes

**[The smallest visible improvement.]** [One sentence on how it works.]

## 👥 Who uses it

| Role | v1 build | Deferred to v2+ |
|---|---|---|
| **[Role 1]** | ✅ Active. [What they do.] | — |
| **[Role 2]** | [Schema-supported? UI? not yet?] | [When they get full access] |

## 🚀 Repository and delivery

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| GitHub | [not connected / planned / owner/repository] |
| GitHub Project | [linked URL / planned / skipped] |
| Visibility | [private / public / n/a] |
| Hosting | [Vercel / Cloudflare / Netlify / other / none] |
| CI | [configured / planned / skipped] |
| Protected default branch | [configured / pending first successful CI run / planned / skipped] |
| Production smoke | [configured / planned / not applicable] |

See [`delivery-workflow.md`](./delivery-workflow.md) for exact commands, required checks, deployment flow, and rollback expectations.

## 🤖 Agent capabilities

MCPs **recommended** for this project so AI agents can do meaningful work without copy-paste. **Run the install commands below at the end of `/workflow-init` (Stage 9 hand-off)** — they require an agent restart, so installing earlier would wipe the discovery interview context.

| MCP | Purpose | Install command (Claude Code) |
|---|---|---|
| `<mcp-name>` | <what it unlocks for the agent> | `claude mcp add <name> --scope user -- npx -y <package>` |

After install: restart your agent. Verify with `claude mcp list`.

> Populated by `/workflow-init` based on stack + answer to "will you call external services?" question. Common picks:
> - `neon` or `postgres` MCP for DB introspection
> - `context7` for up-to-date library docs
> - `playwright` for browser-driven testing (web/desktop-web only)
> - `vercel` / `cloudflare` MCPs for deploy ops
> - `stripe` MCP for payment testing
>
> Each user installs locally on their machine — these aren't auto-installed by cloning the repo. If `/workflow-init` was skipped or this is a simple project (no DB, no auth, no external calls), this whole section can be deleted.

## 🌐 [Routing / multi-tenancy model]

> Delete this section if your project is single-tenant. Otherwise: how do hosts / subdomains / paths map to data scopes? Who logs in where? What's locked vs. switchable?

---

## 🗄️ Data layer

**[DB choice] + [ORM choice].** Source of truth.

[2–3 sentences on the migration discipline, how schemas are isolated if multi-tenant, what gets denormalized for query patterns.]

See [`content-types.md`](../specs/content-types.md) for the entity catalog and [`data-layer.md`](../specs/data-layer.md) for the full schema + query helpers.

### Entity overview

```mermaid
erDiagram
  parent ||--o{ child : owns
  parent {
    uuid id PK
    text name
    timestamptz created_at
  }
  child {
    uuid id PK
    uuid parent_id FK
    text status
    timestamptz created_at
  }
```

### Day-one invariants (baked into migration #1)

| Win | Why |
|---|---|
| 🔒 [Invariant 1] | [Why it's worth enforcing at the DB layer day one] |
| 🔑 [Invariant 2] | [...] |

---

## 🖼️ Interface principles

**[App archetype — operational console / consumer surface / dashboard / etc.]** Inspiration: [refs].

### Anti-sprawl principles

1. **[Max nav items in v1.]**
2. **[Selection is client state vs. URL state.]**
3. **[Density vs. whitespace stance.]**
4. **[Keyboard-first or pointer-first.]**

## 💰 Path to revenue

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  V1["v1<br/>internal only"] --> V15["v1.5<br/>add pilots<br/>prove value"]
  V15 --> Productize["Productize<br/>public signup"]
  Productize --> Scale["Sustainable revenue"]
```

[2–3 sentences on the revenue plan and when each stage triggers.]
